The main objective of this project is to manage the animals in a zoo. For this we're developing only APIs, no user interface or 
command line input/output. APIs will be tested and graded using Postman. Implement the following 4 REST API endpoints 
and their corresponding functionality:

/api/zoo (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
GET: This API should return all animals from the zoo
POST: This API should allow to add a new animal to the zoo
PUT: This API should allow to update the active column of an animal, provided a given id
DELETE: This API should allow to delete an animal, provided a given id
Note: ids should be created automatically
